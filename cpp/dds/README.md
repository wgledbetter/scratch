# DDS Playground

Just learning.
Should really have been making more notes today.
Not that I'd go back and read them, it just helps with retention.

## TODO

- [ ] TCP Example.
- [ ] Implement late joiners as two executables. Maybe with pub-sub in both so the main publisher knows how long to hang out.
- [ ] Combine TCP and late joiners.
- [ ] Make one side of the TCP example in python. <https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/fastdds/getting_started/simple_python_app/simple_python_app.html>
- [ ] Dynamic XML example.
- [ ] Can OpenDDS talk to FastDDS?
